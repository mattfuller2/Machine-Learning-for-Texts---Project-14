# Movie Review Sentiment Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on building a model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, based on a dataset of IMDB reviews. The goal of the project is to create a highly accurate classification model that can predict the sentiment of unseen movie reviews, with a target F1 score of at least 0.85.
